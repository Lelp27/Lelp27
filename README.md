Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

Ms. Synthetic Biology  

I studied Synthetic Biology and Computational Skills.
So i can do genetic engineering and databased analysis (called wet lab and dry lab).

In master course, I studied Synthetic Biology such as High-throughput techniques and Bio Automation System (Biofoundry).
Now I'm learning WebFrameworks and AI techniques to make Web tools for Synthetic Biology.
